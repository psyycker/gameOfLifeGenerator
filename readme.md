# Game of Life Generator

This project is still work in progress and subject to change :) <br/>

This project is using worker_thread for multi threading with Nodejs

##Usage

Check prerequisites first <br/>
Run `npm install` <br/>
Set up your simulation within the index.js (temporary) <br/>
Run `npm start` <br/>
Be patient :) (It can take a while depending the power of your CPU

### Prerequisites
